# Travel website template

This is a template built entirely on the frontend using ReactJS.
In order to run the website make sure you have node.js installed. Then once you cd into the directory where the application is saved, run the following commands:
### `npm install`
### `npm start`

This will install all dependencies needed and start the website on your local port 3000.
